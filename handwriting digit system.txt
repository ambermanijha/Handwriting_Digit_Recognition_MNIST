2. Model Goal:- to make a model which reads digits 
   basically reading what is on the text and giving out the output for the same 

 
Expected Plan :- 
To create a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits and outputs what is written (i.e., digit classification), you can follow these steps:

1. Dataset Selection
Choose a dataset that contains handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels. The MNIST dataset is a classic choice for this task, but you can also use other datasets like the USPS or Fashion-MNIST, depending on your application.

2. Data Preprocessing
Normalization: Scale the pixel values of the images to a range of 0 to 1, which helps the model converge faster.
Flattening: Flatten the 2D image arrays into 1D arrays to feed into the model.
3. Model Selection
Select a machine learning model suitable for image classification tasks. A common choice is a convolutional neural network (CNN) due to its effectiveness in capturing spatial relationships in images. CNNs are especially well-suited for tasks like handwritten digit recognition.

4. Model Building
Define the architecture: Design a CNN architecture consisting of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Compile the model: Choose appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification), optimizer (e.g., Adam), and metrics (e.g., accuracy).
5. Training
Split the data: Divide your dataset into training and validation sets.
Train the model: Feed the training data into the model and adjust the weights based on the loss function using backpropagation.
Validate the model: Evaluate the model on the validation set to monitor its performance and prevent overfitting.
6. Model Evaluation
Test the model: Use a separate test dataset to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Metrics: Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
7. Model Deployment
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it for predictions:

Input: Provide an image of a handwritten digit.
Output: Obtain the predicted digit label from the model.
